Hello! This is Yuxuan Zhang (张宇轩). I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Centre for Quantum Information and Quantum Control](https://cqiqc.physics.utoronto.ca/), University of Toronto, with a joint appointment at the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). Hosted by [Yong-Baek Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/ybkimgroup/home) and [Juan Carrasquilla](https://www.phys.ethz.ch/the-department/people/person-detail.MzM2NzEw.TGlzdC81MTUsMTE3MjU5OTI5OQ==.html), I have broad interests in quantum computing, condensed matter physics and machine learning. I'm strongly motivated by answering questions like: How does our knowledge in many-body physics advance quantum computation, and how can quantum computers help us to better understand the laws of nature? How do we best use machine learning tools to improve quantum computer designs?

I completed my early education in my hometown, Tangshan, and graduated from Tangshan No. 1 High School in 2013. I then earned my B.S. in physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara with Highest Honors in 2016. Following this, I spent a year at the Institute of High Energy Physics, where I had fun with fundamental particles. In 2017, I attended [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~qic/) and became interested in quantum information and quantum matter. There, I was lucky to be mentored by [Andrew C. Potter](https://qmi.ubc.ca/team-member/andrew-potter/) and [Scott Aaronson](https://scottaaronson.blog/) throughout my Ph.D. studies. During my leisure time, I also enjoy traveling, photography, classical music, and RTS games.

After all, what have I learned about the quantum world so far? Well, in short:

You observed me, and thus we entangled -- though I could never be a copy of you.
