Hello! This is Yuxuan (Vincent) Zhang (张宇轩). I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in [Prof. Dmitry Abanin](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/dmitry-abanin)’s group that superposes between Princeton and EPFL. My research lies at the interface of quantum information, quantum many-body physics, and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on quantum algorithms, quantum advantage, and AI-assisted physical science descovery. Broadly, I am motivated by questions such as: How can our understanding of many-body quantum systems and complexity theory guide the design of useful quantum algorithms? How can quantum devices, in turn, help us probe new phases of matter and new frontiers of computation? And how do we best leverage machine learning tools to co-design quantum hardware and software?

I completed my early education in my hometown, Tangshan, and graduated from Tangshan No. 1 High School in 2013. I received my B.S. in physics with Highest Honors from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2016, and then spent a year at the Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing, working on collider physics and detector reconstruction. 

I then obtained my Ph.D. in physics from The University of Texas at Austin, where I was advised by Andrew C. (Drew) Potter and Scott Aaronson. From Fall 2023-2025, I was a CQIQC Fellow at the [Centre for Quantum Information and Quantum Control](https://cqiqc.physics.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto, with a joint appointment at the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, working closely with [Yong-Baek Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/ybkimgroup/yong-baek-kim), [Juan Carrasquilla](https://www.phys.ethz.ch/the-department/people/person-detail.jcarrasquill.html), and [Dvira Segal](https://sites.chem.utoronto.ca/chemistry/dsegal/). 

Outside of research, I enjoy traveling, photography, classical music, and real-time strategy games.

After all, what have I learned about the quantum world so far? Well, in short:
